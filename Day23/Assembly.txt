what is assembly?
Assembly is a precompiled chunk of .NET code that can be run by CLR. In other words, it is nothing but a single unit of deployment. 
We have various types of assemblies such as DLL and EXE. If you add any library to our project it will become DLL. DLL stands for dynamic link library.

Relation b/w assembly in c#?

EXE:
An exe always runs in its own address space i.e., It is a separate process.
The purpose of an EXE is to launch a separate application of its own.

DLL:
A dll always needs a host exe to run. i.e., it can never run in its own address space.
The purpose of a DLL is to have a collection of methods/classes which can be re-used from some other application.
DLL is Microsoft's implementation of a shared library.

The file format of DLL and exe is essentially the same. Windows recognizes the difference between DLL and EXE through PE Header in the file.
