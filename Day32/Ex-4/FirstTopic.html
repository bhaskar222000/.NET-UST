        <h2><center>Sachin Tendulkar</center></h2>
        <p>
            <b>Sachiiiiiiin, Sachin!</b><br>

           You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard the chant.
           The chant - one that a billion people once lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede 
           and echo across the city and the seas. It is a name that continues to inspire many, 
           not only in India,but all over the world, to take up the sport.Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar
           was that cricketer whose personality and aura upstaged any cricketing contest; yet he
           maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game.To the people of India, the 5’5”
           giant of a man was much more than that.He was an emotion; a symbol of hope in a nation
           that revered him as nothing short of a God.

           Ironically, in the midst of the over-the-top veneration and 
           in spite of the pedestal he has been placed on, it is his humility and the ability 
           to cast it all out that has allowed him to put forth his best performances on the 
           international stage for over two decades. Having played across generations, 
           Tendulkar started playing Test cricket in a white shirt that could just as easily
           have been used as a school uniform, and scored his last Test hundred in a niche 
           Nike jersey that was impossible to buy over the counter, and would later be 
           auctioned for millions.

           In a nutshell
In the midst of all the constant adulation he has received over a significantly transitional period for cricket, commercially and otherwise, and in a sea of statistics that every Tendulkar-centric conversation attracts, it is sometimes easy to forget that he was perhaps the most complete batsman of his generation - one who combined natural talent with hard work and dedication; one who recognized the importance of shaping and polishing the diamond. This uncommon blend of dedication and ability made him stand out in the crowd, and made him the legend that is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.

Tendulkar has been the single biggest factor behind the explosion of popularity that cricket enjoys in India which led to the Indian board becoming the richest and most powerful in world cricket. In a country already predisposed to cricket, Tendulkar gave the people a hero they could look upto regardless of age, colour, creed or sect - and catapulted cricket from a sport to a religion in the subcontinent.

The summit of all things cricket
In a game riddled with statistics, he owns almost every batting record worth owning, including that of the most runs in Test and ODI cricket, the most hundreds in the two formats, and the highest number of centuries in international cricket - a mind-numbing 100. Despite a tough start to his ODI career, Tendulkar found his calling at the top of the order when he was sent to open against New Zealand in 1994 and struck a 49-ball 82, and made the opening spot his own. He went on to compile 49 ODI hundreds by the end of his career - eclipsing the second-best by nineteen hundreds.

A World Cup veteran
Moreover, this career spanned over six World Cup appearances, from 1992 to 2011, in which he made two appearances in the final (2003 and 2011), finally getting his hands on the coveted trophy on that enchanting night in Mumbai on the 2nd of April 2011, getting the swan-song he deserved in front of his home crowd in Mumbai.

“He has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years; it’s time we carried him on our shoulders\"
- Virat Kohli’s words after his idol Sachin Tendulkar finally got his hands on the long-awaited World Cup trophy.

Despite all the talk about Tendulkar’s failures under pressure, his performances in big events were difficult to ignore. In his two World Cup final appearances, Tendulkar flattered to deceive with scores of 4 (2003 final vs. Australia) and 18 (2011 final vs. Sri Lanka). Nevertheless, his overall performances and contributions over the course of the aforementioned tournaments played a huge part in getting India to the final in the first place. In the 2003 edition of the tournament, Tendulkar scored an astonishing 673 runs in the tournament, going past his own record of 523 runs in a World Cup tournament (1996 World Cup) - a record that still stands. Moreover, in India’s 2011 victorious World Cup campaign, he was once again India’s highest run-scorer and the second-highest overall, with 482 runs in the tournament at an average of 53.55, with 2 hundreds in the league stages (against England and South Africa) and 2 crucial fifties in the knockouts (against Australia and Pakistan).

With a doubt, though, Tendulkar’s fondest World Cup memory remains the moment he finally received the medal he had been waiting for for the best part of two decades and a bit, and of course, the moment he got his hands on the World Cup trophy.

The Initiation
There are so many tales about how Tendulkar was introduced to cricket, we may never know the absolute truth. According to legend, his half-brother, Ajit, with whom Sachin \"lived the dream”, took him to Sharadashram School in Mumbai and introduced him to Ramakant Acharekar, his first coach, at the age of eleven in an effort to focus his energy on something productive.

Since then, Tendulkar’s life was Eat, Sleep, Cricket.

He changed schools, trained hard, played truckloads of matches, and soon, the name Sachin Tendulkar was famous across Mumbai. There was a whisper, whenever he was slated to bat in a school match, as crowds gathered to watch him bat. From a tender age, he would live up to the expectations too, as he famously scored 326* in a record-breaking partnership of 664 with Vinod Kambli - the highest partnership in any form of competitive cricket at the time.

It was only a matter of time before he was a part of the Mumbai team and made his domestic debut. However, he was certainly too young to be facing senior bowlers, and this raised several eyebrows. However, when Dilip Vengsarkar, India’s captain at the time, watched him bat against Kapil Dev in the nets, the case of the child prodigy was escalated immediately. He made his first domestic appearance at the age of 14, and struck centuries on Ranji and Duleep trophy debut. He continued to pile on the runs, and an India call-up beckoned, a couple of years later.<br>
