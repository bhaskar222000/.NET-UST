_id	long

_from	string

_to	string

_subject	string

_content	string

_receivedDate	DateTime

_size	double

Mark all the attributes as private.

Include appropriate properties.

Add a default constructor and a parameterized constructor to take in all attributes in the given order:
    public Mail(long _id, string _from, string _to, string _subject, string _content, DateTime _receivedDate, double _size)

b)Create a Class MailFolder with the following attributes:

Member Field Name	Type

Mark all the attributes as private.

Include appropriate properties.

Add a default constructor and a parameterized constructor to take in all attributes in the given order:
 MailFolder(string _name, List<Mail> _mailList). In constructor pass the _mailList value as an empty list.
 Only one folder will be present at a time.

c) Create the following static method in Mail class,

Method Name	Description

public static Mail CreateMail(string detail)	This method accepts a string which contains mail details separated by commas.
 Split the details and create a mail object from the details and return it.

The mail details should be given as a comma-separated value in the below order,

_id,_from,_to, _subject, _content, _receivedDate, _size

d) Create the following methods in MailFolder class,

Method Name	Description

public void AddMailToFolder(Mail mail)	--> This method accepts a mail object and add the mail to the mail list of the current mail folder.

public bool RemoveMailFromFolder(long id)--> This method will get the id of the mail and delete the mail with the specified _id from the current folder.

If a mail with the given _id found, delete the mail and return true. If a mail with the _id is not found return false.

public void DisplayMails()--> This method will display the mail list in the current folder.

If the mail list is empty display "No mails to show", else

display "Mails in [folder name]" and display all the mail details in the specified format. Where [folder name] specifies the name of the folder.

After deletion, if true is returned print "Mail successfully deleted", else print "Mail not found in the folder". 
After adding mail to the folder, print "Mail successfully added".

Note: The above print statements should be present in the Main method.

Display double values correct to one decimal place.

When the “mail” object is printed, it should display the following format

Print format:

Console.WriteLine("{0} {1,15} {2,15} {3,15} {4,15} {5,15} {6,15}", "Id", "From", "To", "Subject", "Content", "Received Date", "Size");
